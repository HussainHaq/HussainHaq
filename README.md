Hello I am Husain Haq
I am a graduate at Northern Illinois University with bachelor's in Computer Science.
My experience lies mostly in app and web development. During my time at NIU I found a passion for software development. The tech I am experienced with is React.js, Node.js, MongoDB(NoSQL), and Express for web development. For App development I have experience with Swift native programming and the Flutter framework (With the Dart object oriented langauge). 
Other tech that I have experience with are SQL, Flask.py, Google Firebase + Google's NoSQL, Python, Java, and C++/C. 
With Rectify I was able to get professional experience as a full stack developer. 
Rectify is a start up company that creates websites or applications for clients. I have a huge passion for programming and am always in the know for new tech and trying them out.
